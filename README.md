Working on an out-of-control project? Need to keep track of the hectic status in your life? Do you simply just want a scale loosely based on Ron Paul quotes?

This is the app for you.

From a scale of "It hasn't even begun yet" to "It's over", this mobile Paul Scale provides a way for you to accurately keep track of the status of anything in your life.
Using Space Age technologies, the app will remember your previous status between sessions, so you'll always know where you recently fell on the scale.
Want to let the world know where you currently fall on the scale? Long-pressing any status will quickly allow you to tweet/f'book/plus/etc your current Paul Scale status.
